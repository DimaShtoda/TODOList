File main.js contain marked section such as repository data. It needed for the back-end emulation. 
Also in this section were created 12 tasks, which has been puted in todo list.
They are an example of preliminarily created tasks.
Section, that marked 'Function for data repository' contains functions for the data access. If needed 
these functions can be modified for using with any database. The other part of business logic do not

Searching task by title starts when the key Enter pressed. If search title input does not contain 
any char todo list shows all tasks with any title. Searching by status and priority starts after
changing value of the current list.
